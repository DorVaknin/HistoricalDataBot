So what's left here that I can do:
- need to verify that the volume equation outputs good coins // looks pretty good
- add more indicators s.e. M.A.
- deploy the bot onto a domain with a cronjob
    - understand how much cpu the bot takes and if it is free using AWS
    - keep looking on AWS try to understand how much MB I'm using and if I might have infinite loop. when to timeout my bot in order to avoid exaggerated fees
    - look on firebase
- add mechanism that saves all the coins that were tested in a tempStore. each exchange, filters the coins that already tested and test only coins that are new in the current exchange.
